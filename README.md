CreditPathAI

Automating and optimizing the loan recovery lifecycle by modeling repayment behavior using diverse data.

üìå Project Overview

CreditPathAI is a machine learning‚Äìdriven platform designed to predict borrower default risk and provide personalized recovery recommendations. By leveraging open-source technologies, the system ensures cost-effectiveness, scalability, and reliability.

The primary goal is to improve delinquency recovery efficiency and empower collection agents with actionable insights.

üéØ Project Objective

Predict borrower default risk using historical loan datasets.

Recommend personalized recovery actions for borrowers.

Utilize open-source tools for efficient, scalable, and reliable implementation.

Provide actionable insights to assist collection agents in decision-making.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
1. Data Ingestion

Load datasets from Kaggle Loan Default Dataset and Microsoft R Server Loan Credit Risk.

Tools: CSV/Excel ingestion, SQLite/PostgreSQL.

2. Feature Engineering

Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.

Engineer features for borrower behavior, repayment trends, and credit utilization.

3. Modeling & Prediction

Train machine learning models to predict borrower default probability.

Compare models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

4. Recovery Strategy Recommendation

Generate personalized recovery strategies based on borrower profiles.

Support decision-making for collection teams.

5. Deployment

Implement APIs/ dashboards for real-time predictions and insights.

Ensure scalable architecture for production environments.
