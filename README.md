CreditPathAI

Automating and optimizing the loan recovery lifecycle by modeling repayment behavior using diverse data.

🚀 Project Objective

To design and develop a machine learning–driven platform that:

Predicts borrower default risk.

Recommends personalized recovery actions.

Ensures cost-effectiveness, scalability, and reliability using open-source technologies.

Improves delinquency recovery efficiency and equips collection agents with actionable insights.

📌 Project Workflow
1. Data Ingestion

Load datasets from Kaggle Loan Default Dataset and Microsoft R Server Loan Credit Risk.

Tools: CSV/Excel ingestion, SQLite/PostgreSQL.

2. Feature Engineering

Perform cleaning, normalization, joining, and feature extraction.

Examples: repayment velocity, credit utilization, etc.

(More workflow steps can be added as your project develops: Model Training, Evaluation, Deployment, etc.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)

Databases: SQLite, PostgreSQL

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI/Tableau

Deployment: Flask/Django, Docker, Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)
